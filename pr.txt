What is the Innovative Change Being Done in SINP?

This category allows the province to target the skilled workers whose occupation is listed in the SINP Occupations in Demand list of Saskatchewan. Earlier applications under this category of SINP were submitted within a brief period of time; however, this system has now been replaced with the EOI (Expression of Interest) system that allows the eligible candidate to submit their profile in the pool and moreover, candidates can now update and improve their profile while being present in the pool to receive an ITA (Invitation to apply) for Canada’s Permanent Residence.

So, have a look at a well-written procedure to apply for SINP

· Choose the right category you wish to apply under such as International skilled worker, Saskatchewan Experience category, entrepreneur and farm category and international graduate entrepreneur category.

· Create an EOI (Expression of Interest) profile online through a portal. Post submitting your EOI, your profile will be reviewed and evaluated on the basis of six selection factors in the SINP point’s assessment grid.

· In this step, the candidates with the highest scores in the SINP point’s assessment grid will be invited to apply for the provincial nomination. Post receiving an invitation, the candidate has 60 days to submit the application with a proper set of documents to receive a provincial nomination from the province of Saskatchewan.

· The profile will then be processed by the provincial immigration office.

· The immigration authorities will then review your EOI, thereby approving the profile of the candidate under the SINP and as a result, the candidate will be nominated for PR status in Canada.

· Post receiving a provincial nomination from the province of Saskatchewan, the status gets updated in the express entry profile of the candidate. Now, the candidate has 30 days to accept that SINP nomination.

· Once the nomination is accepted, IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada) will then invite the candidate for Canada PR Visa.

If the candidate meets all the requirements, then IRCC will give the legal status of Canada PR.
